<b>Graduate Research Opportunities in 3-CFD Lab</b>
<br>
<br>
CFD (Computational Financial Derivatives) Laboratory of the Computer Science Department is recruiting graduate research assistants.
<br>
<br>

Research Focus: A graduate student will actively participate in the broad research areas of Computational Finance Applications, Grid/Cloud Computing or ad hoc networks at CFD Lab. For example, in the Computational Finance, our research focus is on designing and developing algorithms for pricing of options and other problems in the parallel, distributed and multi-core computing environments using various techniques. Applicants should have some basic understanding of the financial markets and good working knowledge with programming languages. Successful applicants will be exclusively trained in the cross disciplinary area of computational finance where mathematics, statistics, computer science and finance come together. In Cloud computing our focus has been in two areas: Resources Pricing and ' Financial Computing as a Software Service. In ad hoc networks our focus is on routing protocols for various applications such as Mobile networks (MANET) and Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). Please refer to the publications link for further details.

<br>
<br>

Application Procedure: You are encouraged to contact Dr. Ruppa K. Thulasiram via email (tulsi at cs dot umanitoba dot ca) with your resume, transcripts, statement of purpose. Before sending in the resume, you are also encouraged to go over the publications list and request three or four papers for reviewing and for further discussions.
<br>
<br>

Funding : Admission into our graduate program does not guarantee funding. My funding is committed to PhD students in the lab. Of course, there are other means of funding for example, University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship and the Guaranteed Funding at the Department of Computer Science. These two and other scholarships/fellowships are highly competitive. Please visit the CS Page or Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) page for details. You are encouraged to contact Dr. Ruppa K. Thulasiram via email (tulsi at cs dot umanitoba dot ca) with your resume, transcripts, statement of purpose. Before sending in the resume, you are also encouraged to go over the publications list and request three or four papers for reviewing and for further discussions.
